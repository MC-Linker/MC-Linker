By using the Discord bot `MC Linker`, you agree that you have read and agreed to this policy.
This is our Privacy Policy, which will describe the types of data collected, how it is used, how to opt out of data
collection, and how to remove your data.
The terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to the owner and moderators of `MC Linker`. The terms "bot" and "MC Linker" refer
to the Discord bot itself.
We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes that are made will be made effective immediately. If you are
a regular user of our bot, please make sure you are kept up to date with this Privacy Policy.


# PRIVACY STATEMENT
We respect the privacy of your information. This policy describes the types of information that we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our bot, as well as describing our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.
**This policy applies to any data collected through these sources:**
- Data provided directly by users
- Any commands ran

# THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

**Connections:**<br>
MC Linker collects and stores Minecraft usernames that you tie to your Discord account. This will only be
personally identifiable if the username is personally identifiable.
Our bot also stores server connection files in JSON format that are tied to your Discord server.
<br>Server connections can be of two types:
Plugin connections include the IP the server is running on, and the path to the Minecraft world
folder.
FTP connections do not include the IP but rather the FTP credentials needed to communicate with the server.

This data is provided voluntarily with the commands `/connect` as well as `/account` and can be removed by the user at
any time. User and server connection files are stored locally on the bot’s server.
<br><br>**Commands:**<br>
Any command executed through our Bot is logged in the console temporarily. This includes the command name, command
arguments, the tag of the user who executed the command, as well as the name of the server in which it was executed.
These logs will always be deleted within a week or after a restart of the bot.

# HOW WE USE INFORMATION

**Connections:**<br>
Connection data is used to provide the functionality of the bot by allowing the bot to communicate with the
Minecraft server.
**Commands:**<br>
Commands are logged to help track error messages and bot abuse. When an error occurs, the command logs can be used to
see the activity that occurred around the time of an error.

This data is not shared with any third parties.

# OPTING OUT

How to opt out of having this data collected:
<br>**Server owners/admins:**<br>
To opt out of having any commands logged from your server, kick MC Linker from your Discord server.
<br>**Server members:**<br>
To opt out of having your commands logged from a server using our bot, do not use any commands from the bot or leave the
Discord server.

# REMOVAL OF DATA

**Connections:**<br>
User and Server connections can be removed by using the implemented commands `/account disconnect` or `/disconnect` for
the respective connections.
<br><br>**Commands:**<br>
Command logs are generally deleted every week. If you still want to urgently remove command logs, please contact me
through the contacts listed at the bottom of this policy, with the Command name and User Tag of the logs you would like
to have removed.

# THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES

MC Linker may link to third-party websites. These websites are separate from our bot and will have their own
privacy policies. Any data collected through these third-party websites is separate and unrelated to the bot.
